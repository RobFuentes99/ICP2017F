Q4.  
Each loop, the function takes the square root of r a given 'n' amount of times.  Each time, the answer gets a little less accurate, as the number r will eventually become a decimal that is not fully computable by MatLab.  Therefore, the function is designed to show the decimal flaws of MatLab.

Q5.  
This function takes a changing variable, eps, starts it at 1.0, and continuously divides it by 2 until the resulting eps is no longer negligible/computable to MatLab.  It then displays the final eps value, as an example of exactly how small of a number MatLab can handle.  

Q7. (C)  
It is an immensely larger loop when dealing with the larger numbers, so MatLab takes longer to compute it.
